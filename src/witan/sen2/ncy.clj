  Age at the start of the school/academic year is the age on 31st August
  prior to the school/academic year, per:

  - The [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions/school-starting-age),
  which (as of 23-NOV-2022) states:
  \"Most children start school full-time in the September after their
  fourth birthday. This means they’ll turn 5 during their first school
  year. For example, if your child’s fourth birthday is between 1
  September 2021 and 31 August 2022 they will usually start school in
  September 2022.\".

  - The [2022 SEN2 guide](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1013751/SEN2_2022_Guide.pdf),
  which states in section 2, part 1, item 1.1 that: \"age breakdown
  refers to age as at 31 August 2021\", implying (since this is for
  the January 2022 SEN2 return) that age for SEN2 breakdowns is as of
  31-AUG prior to starting the school year."

  "Maps age in whole number of years on 31st August prior to starting

  Early years NCYs are coded numerically, with reception as year 0 and

  Ages and NCYs for children aged 4 to 15 at the start of school/academic
  year (reception to NCY 11) are per https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum.
  Extension to ages 0-3 (NCYs -4 to -1) and ages 16-24 (NCYs 12 to 20),
  is by linear extrapolation, such that the offset between NCY and age
  at the beginning of the school/academic year is -4.

  The maximum age for SEND is 25, but per the relevant legislation
  \"a local authority may continue to maintain an EHC plan for a young
  person until the end of the academic year during which the young
  person attains the age of 25\", such that they will have been 24 at
  the start of that school/academic year, hence the maximum age in
  this map is 24 (NCY 20)."
