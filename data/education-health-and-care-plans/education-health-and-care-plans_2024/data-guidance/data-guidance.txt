2. The method for collecting data on establishments has changed from previous years. Previously, local authorities provided data on the number of EHC plans where the child or young person was attending through a set list of establishment types. From 2023, information on the specific establishment has been recorded, with the Unique Reference Number (URN), UK Provider Reference Number or where neither are applicable, a specific category recorded. As a result of this change, caution should be taken when comparing across years by establishment types.

Footnotes:

1. From 2023, the data collection changed from aggregated figures at local authority level, to a person level collection. This has been a major change in approach and as such care should be taken with comparisons across this period. Further detail on the change is provided in the publication and supporting methodology.
2. Data on ceased plans changed from 2023 to include a more comprehensive set of reasons for plans ending. Data was collected for all plans that ended. Prior to 2023, data on ceased plans only covered children of compulsory school age and care should be taken when comparing across this period.
3. Data on movements between different setting types is not yet available for the 2022 calendar year. This is expected to be added to the latest publication in a future update.
4. Timeliness figures are based on assessments completed within the calendar year where no mediation or tribunal has taken place.
5. This data item has been marginally impacted by reporting issues in some local authorities – please see the methodology for further information.
